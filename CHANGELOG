Version 0.3.0 

* Feature: Disable or enable build and server events. 

Version 0.2.0 

* Feature: Allow setting different rooms for different projects, and allow to use the default configuration or none, or inherit from the parent project. As a consequence, server up and down events are sent to only the default room, if configured.

* Improvement: Added a button on the configuration page to test the API credentials.
* Bug: Fixed UI bug where disabling the plugin after saving settings didn't respond.
